// Description:
// It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

// Solution:

const removeChar = str => {
    str = str.split("")
    str.pop()
    str.shift()
    str = str.join("")
    return str
};
